To resolve this issue, ensure proper memory management practices are used throughout the class. Using ARC or manual retain/release, it is crucial to manage the lifetime of the 'AnotherClass' object properly within the 'MyClass' class. The solution depends on whether you are using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) or manual retain/release. 

**ARC Solution:**

By using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), the issue is mostly handled automatically. However, you still need to ensure that there are no strong reference cycles.  Ensure the properties are properly set to `weak` or `assign` if the `MyClass` does not own the `AnotherClass` object.

**Manual Retain/Release Solution (Deprecated):**

If you are using manual retain/release,  you must ensure that you retain the object when you need to keep it and release it when it's no longer needed.  Proper balance between retain and release calls is essential to prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers.  Use `retainCount` method cautiously for debugging purposes only.  In this scenario, a correct implementation requires ensuring that `AnotherClass` is released when it is no longer needed within `MyClass`. This often involves releasing the object in the `dealloc` method of `MyClass`.
