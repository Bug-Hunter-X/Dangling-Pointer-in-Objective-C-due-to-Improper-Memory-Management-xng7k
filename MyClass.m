In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically regarding object ownership and the use of retain/release cycles.  Consider the scenario where you have a class, 'MyClass', that holds a strong reference to another object, 'AnotherClass'. If 'MyClass' is created, and then the 'AnotherClass' object is explicitly released without properly managing the reference in 'MyClass', a dangling pointer and potential crash will occur. This is often tricky to find as the immediate release might not always lead to an obvious crash but may result in unexpected behaviour later.
